<h2>前言</h2>

<i>Of train-boasts, plane-shame and electric automobiles</i>

<small>The words of 2019 reflect the rise of climate-change activism</small>

还记得第35期魔鬼营周报里写过的年度单词吗？


<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">柯林斯词典</span>的<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">年度主题词</span>是关于气候，<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">CLIMATE STRIKE</span>。 

<!-- <img src="./asset/35/collins.png" alt="魔鬼营榜单"> -->

至于为什么选它，和数据有关系。柯林斯词典编纂者发现，与2018年相比，今年这个词的使用频率增加了100倍。

<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">牛津字典</span>选的是也是关于气候，<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">CLIMATE EMERGENCY</span>。

相比而言，《经济学人》认为<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">Dictionary.com</span>选的‘<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">EXISTENTIAL</span>’更贴切些。不管是柯林斯还是牛津还是Dictionary.com。

各家字典选的年度词虽然不同，不过都算不上积极向上。不知道2020会不会有逆转？

已经是2020啦，如果为你的2019选一个关键词，你会选什么？

<h2>正文</h2>
<br>

01 Identifying shifts in the Earth’s climate requires decades of data, not just the <br>observations of 2019 or any other single year. Climate change moves slowly, which is part of its calamitous power. Huge fires in California and Australia are probably worsened by the phenomenon—but no blaze can unequivocally be pinned on it, a <br>fact <b>seized on</b> by those who would rather avoid the subject.<i> Yet in the <b>growing <br>strength and coherence</b> of climate protests, something did change <b><u>discernibly</u></b> in <br>2019</i>.


<div style="text-align:left; font-family:verdana;background: white; padding:10px; border: 2px solid darkred">

<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">seize on 对...大为关注；抓住（有用的事物）</span>

If you <b>seize on</b> something or seize upon it, you show great interest in it, often because it is useful to you. 

🌰 Newspapers <b>seized on</b> the results as proof that global warming wasn't really happening. 

各报纸纷纷以此结果为证据来证明全球变暖并没有真正发生。 

🌰 The government has eagerly <b>seized on</b> the evidence to deny any link between deprivation and crime. 

政府忙不迭地利用这一证词来否认贫困和犯罪之间地任何联系。

🌰  ... a <b>growing</b> <i>number</i> of immigrants

日益增长地移民数量

🌰  Security experts were delighted to see a president publicly address what has been a <b>growing</b> <i>concern</i> for a decade.

安全专家很高兴看到总统公开谈论这个十年来越来越引人关注的问题。

🌰  But only recently do more consumers appear to be paying heed to those concerns, as part of the <b>growing</b> <i>interest</i> in whole and natural foods.

但近来的确越来越多的消费者出于对天然食物兴趣，开始把关注它的厉害关系了。

02 <i>Extinction Rebellion, a new movement, <b>disrupted</b> major cities.</i>  Greta Thunberg, a teenage activist, was Time’s Person of the Year; she travelled by boat to a climate summit in New York to avoid flying (and the associated carbon emissions). Another summit, in Madrid, ended in acrimony. <i><u>Policy</u> may not have evolved much, but wider <u>attitudes</u> did—and with them, the language in which the issue is discussed</i>.

<div style="text-align:left; font-family:verdana;background: white; padding:10px; border: 2px solid darkred">

<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">disrupt 使中断;扰乱</span>

If someone or something <b>disrupt</b>s an event, system, or process, they cause difficulties that <i>prevent it from</i> continuing or operating in a <i>normal</i> way.

🌰 If you go into a theater where somebody is being operated on and you<br> <b>disrupt</b>, you are actually committing murder,"he said.

“如果你闯入正在做手术的手术室，你就是在谋杀”，他说。

03 <i>Some climate-related vocabulary was already <b>in circulation</b></i>. After a <b>boiling</b> <br>summer in Germany in 2018, the Society for the German Language chose Heisszeit, “Heat Age”, as its word of that year. (It rhymes nicely with Eiszeit, “ice age”.) In <br>the Netherlands, meanwhile, the Society for Our Language <b>plumped for</b> <br>laadpaalklever, or “charging-post sticker”: someone who uses the electric-car <br>charging space for too long, treating it like a free parking place.
<div style="text-align:left; font-family:verdana;background: white; padding:10px; border: 2px solid darkred">

<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">in circulation （货币等）流通</span>

If something such as money is <b>in circulation</b>, it is being used by the public


🌰  The supply of money <b>in circulation</b> was drastically reduced overnight. 

流通的货币供应量一夜骤减。 

🌰  There is a huge volume of video material in circulation 

有大量录像材料流通



<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">out of circulation/withdrawn from circulation不流通/退出流通</span>

If something is <b>out of circulation</b> or has been <b>withdrawn from circulation</b>, it is no longer available for use by the public. 

🌰  The decision to take 50 and 100 ruble bills <b>out of circulation</b>

让面值为50卢布和10卢布的纸币退出流通的决议

<div style="text-align:left; font-family:verdana;background: white; padding:10px; border: 2px solid darkred">

<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">plump for sb/sth 选择</span>

to choose something or someone, especially after taking time for careful thought


🌰  I <b>plump for</b> a guy displaying handwoven rugs in his window, who seems mildly less excitable than his comrades.
我选择了一位正在橱窗展示手编地毯的小贩，他看上去不像其他小贩那么激动。


🌰  If you ask people whether they would rather have $100 now or $110 a week from now, many people will <b>plump for</b> the $100.
如果你问人们，他们是愿意现在接受100美元，还是一周后获得110美元，许多人会选择现在拿走100美元

04 Van Dale, a dictionary publisher, lets the Dutch-speaking public vote on its word of the year (in separate contests in Belgium and the Netherlands). For 2019 <br>Belgians chose winkelhieren, or “buying local”. The Dutch went with an imported <br>word that has a good case for being the winner in English, too: “boomer”. As Chloe Swarbrick, a 25-year-old member of New Zealand’s parliament, was giving an <br>impassioned speech on the impact of climate change on her generation, she <u>coolly dismissed</u> a <u>heckling</u> older mp with a curt “ok, boomer”. The phrase was already an internet meme; Ms Swarbrick made it the talk of the offline world as well.

05 Babbel, which makes a popular language-learning app, has collected <b>a host of</b> <br>climate-related <u>neologisms</u> from European languages. <u>Flygskam is perhaps the <br>most likely to be permanently adopted into English</u>: “flight-shame”, from Swedish, was popularised by Ms Thunberg’s rise. It also has a <u>nifty</u> corollary: tagskryt, or <br>“train-boasting”, from those who advertise their flygskam by taking ground <br>transport and <u>letting the world know</u>. (Dutch has an equivalent: treintrots.)

<div style="text-align:left; font-family:verdana;background: white; padding:10px; border: 2px solid darkred">
<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">a host of 大量；许多</span><br>
<b>A host of</b> things is a lot of them. 

🌰  <b>A host of</b> problems may delay the opening of the Channel Tunnel<br>
可能推迟英吉利海峡隧道开通的问题一大筐。 

</div>

06 <i>The march of the climate-protest movement has led to the <b>coining</b> of <br><b>disparaging terms</b> by its critics</i>. Italian, for example, has <u>gretini</u>: allegedly mindless followers of Ms Thunberg (-ini is a diminutive suffix, and the word echoes cretini, or “idiots”). The Danish Language Council and Denmark’s national broadcaster jointly chose a similar term as their Word of the Year for 2019: <u>klimatosse</u>, or “climate fool”, used dismissively by Pia Kjaersgaard, a right-wing Danish politician, to <br>explain her party’s poor election performance. Being Danish, she hastened to add <br>that her party is <u>itself</u> concerned about the climate, but that the klimatosser who <br>voted for other parties apparently care about nothing else.

<div style="text-align:left; font-family:verdana;background: white; padding:10px; border: 2px solid darkred">

<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">coin v. 新造，杜撰（单词、短语）</span>

If you <b>coin</b> a word or a phrase, you are the first person to say it. 

🌰 Jaron Lanier <b>coined</b> the term "virtual reality" and pioneered its early development. 

杰伦·拉尼尔创造了“虚拟现实”这个词，并成为推动其早期发展的先驱人物。

</div>

07 <i>Compared with its European <b>cousins</b>, English has not been creative</i>. <span style="background: #888888;color:white; font-size: ">Oxford</span> Dictionaries declared its word of the year to be “climate emergency”. <span style="background: #888888;color:white; font-size: ">Collins</span>, another dictionary-publisher, nominated the slightly more <u>imaginative</u> “climate strike”, originally <u>coined</u> to denote the schooldays that climate activists such as Ms Thunberg began skipping as a protest. (Klimaatspijbelaar, “climate-school-skipper”, was <br>number three in Van Dale’s Dutch vote.)

08 <u>Words of the year are a way for lexicographical types to grab a rare slice of the spotlight, boost interest in language and have a bit of fun</u>. <i>All the same, the pessimistic trajectory of the outcomes suggests a darkening global mood</i>. The American <br>Dialect Society will vote for its word of 2019 at its annual meeting in New Orleans <br>in January. Its previous three choices were “<u>tender-age shelter</u>” (a euphemism for places where America’s border forces keep children separated from their parents), “<u>fake news</u>” (often, these days, meaning real news that powerful people would like to dismiss) and “<u>dumpster fire</u>”. Whether or not it picks a climatic word as an <br>emblem of the bygone year, it is hard to see the society choosing anything <u>upbeat</u>.

<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">a slice of 一份、一片</span>

🌰  ...and <b>slice-of-life</b> photos, including one showing people playing chess inthe rain in Columbus Park

以及一些生活片段的照片，其中有张人们雨中在哥伦比亚公园下象棋的照片。 

🌰  But he said the examination of the relationship was only "<b>a slice</b>" of the investigation. 

但是他表示， 对两者关系的审查只是此次调查的“一部分”。

<div style="text-align:left; font-family:verdana;background: whitesmoke; padding:10px; border: 2px solid white">

<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">Dumpster fire 糟糕的、彻底失控的情势</span>

A complete and utter disaster or a completely chaotic situation, likened to a fire in a dumpster, which quickly becomes uncontrollable. The phrase can be applied to both situations and people.

Dumpster fire是American Dialect Society选出的2016年度词汇。2016年美国大选时变得流行，用来形容当时局势的混乱不堪，但是属于不太正式的口语表达。

🌰 This project is a complete <b>dumpster fire</b>.

这个项目是个彻头彻尾的灾难。

09 Perhaps Dictionary.com <b>captured</b> <i>the feeling best</i> with its word of the year for <br>2019. Neither new nor fancy, it was <u>foreboding</u> nonetheless: “<b>existential</b>”.

<div style="text-align:left; font-family:verdana;background: white; padding:10px;font-size:12px; border: 2px solid darkred">

<span style="background: #595959;color:white; font-size: ">capture 代表（特点）；表现，体现（感情、气氛）</span>

If something or someone <b>capture</b>s a particular quality, feeling, or atmosphere, they represent or express it successfully. 

🌰 Once in a great while, an individual will <b>capture</b> the imagination of people all over the world. 

一旦逢重大时刻，一个人将符合全世界的审美。 

🌰 None of these explanations <b>capture</b> the essence of this phenomenon. 

这些解释均未透过现象抓住问题的本质。 

🌰 Chef Idris Caldora offers an inspired menu that <b>capture</b>s the spirit of the Mediterranean...

厨师德里斯·卡尔多拉开出一份富有地中海特色的菜单，让人眼前一亮。

为什么2019年度关键词是“existential”，Dictionary.com还专门写了“注解”。<br>
<small>（文章链接为https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-year/)</small><br>
有兴趣的小伙伴可以看看全文，内容不长，语言也很简单。Nora截取了部分不错的文字，如下：

<div style="text-align:left; font-family:verdana;background: whitesmoke; padding:10px;font-size:12px; border: 2px solid white">

Existential also inspires us to ask big questions about who we are and what our purpose is in the face of our various challenges—and it reminds us that we can make choices about our lives in how we answer those questions.

Using forests to fight climate change. 

<br>
<h2>正文</h2>
<br>

001 Forests give us shade, <u><font color="seagreen">quiet</font></u> and one of the harder challenges in the fight against climate change. Even as we humans count on forests to soak up <b>a good share of</b> the carbon dioxide we produce, we are threatening their ability to do so. The climate change we are hastening could one day leave us with forests that emit more carbon than they absorb.

a ___ share of 

a <i>large</i> share of 

a <i>fair</i> share of 

a <i>disproportionate</i> share of 

a <i>significant</i> share of 

a <i>growing</i> share of 



002 <i>Thankfully, <b>there is a way out of this trap</b> -- but it involves striking a subtle balance</i>. Helping forests flourish as valuable "carbon sinks" long into the future may require reducing their capacity to sequester carbon now. California is <b>leading the way</b>, as it does on so many climate efforts, in <b>figuring out</b> the details.

strike a balance 寻求平衡

We try to srtike a balance between justice and mercy. 
我们设法做到宽严相济，恩威兼施。

lead the way引路

Domestic companies are expected to lead the way in building new power plants in the country.
本国的公司预期将率先开始在国内建造新的发电厂。



003 The state's proposed Forest Carbon Plan <b>aims to</b> <u><font color="seagreen"> double</font></u> efforts to <u><font color="seagreen"> thin</font></u> out young trees and <u><font color="seagreen"> clear</font></u> brush in parts of the forest, including by controlled burning. This temporarily <b>lower</b>s carbon-carrying capacity. But the remaining trees <u><font color="royalblue">draw</font></u> <b>a greater share of</b> the available moisture, so they grow and thrive, restoring the forest's capacity to <u><font color="royalblue"> pull</font></u> carbon from the air. Healthy trees are also better able to fend off bark beetles. The landscape is rendered less combustible. Even in the event of a fire, fewer trees are consumed.

aim to 旨在

But he said the focus of the deal was to service its customers in China rather than <b>aim to</b> become a "global local bank" .
但他表示，此笔交易的重点是为其中国客户服务，而非成为“全球性当地银行”。



004 The need for such planning is increasingly urgent. Already, since 2010, drought and beetles have <font color="royalblue">killed</font> more than 100 million trees in California, most of them in 2016 alone, and wildfires have <font color="royalblue">scorched</font> hundreds of thousands of acres.

005 California's plan <s>envisions treating</s><mark>to treat</mark> 35,000 acres of forest a year by 2020, and 60,000 by 2030 -- <font color="seagreen"><u>financed</u></font> from the proceeds of the state's emissions-permit auctions. That's only <b>a small share of</b> the total acreage that could benefit, an estimated half a million acres in all, so it will be important to prioritize areas <b>at greatest risk of</b> fire or drought.


You're <b>at greatest risk of</b> osteoporosis if you're white or of Asian descent.
如果你是白人或亚裔的话，你患上骨质疏松的风险最高。


If you smoke, you know you're putting yourself <b>at increased risk of</b> lung cancer.
如果你抽烟，那么你肯定知道自己患肺癌的风险会增加。

But <b>at the risk of</b> looking silly in a few days (or weeks or months or years), I'm going to ignore the obvious pitfalls and forge ahead.
承担着名声受损几天（或者几星期、几月甚至几年）的风险，我决定无视这一明显的陷阱，毅然要趟这条浑水。

006 The strategy also <b>aims to</b> ensure that carbon in woody material removed from the forests is locked away in the form of solid lumber, burned as biofuel in vehicles that would otherwise run on fossil fuels, or used in compost or animal feed. New research on transportation biofuels is under way, and the state plans to encourage lumber production close to forest lands. In future the state proposes to take an inventory of its forests' carbon-storing capacity every five years.

007 State governments <b>are <i>well</i> accustomed to</b> managing forests, including those owned by the U.S. Forest Service, but <i><u>traditionally</u></i> they've focused on wildlife, watersheds and opportunities for recreation. Only  <i><u>recently</u></i>  have they come to see the vital part forests will have to play in storing carbon. California's plan, which is expected to be <font color="seagreen"><u>finalized</u></font> by the governor early next year, should <b>serve</b> as a model.
